<div class="content"><p>A planet is a large, rounded astronomical body that is neither a star nor its remnant. The best available theory of planet formation is the nebular hypothesis, which posits that an interstellar cloud collapses out of a nebula to create a young protostar orbited by a protoplanetary disk. Planets grow in this disk by the gradual accumulation of material driven by gravity, a process called accretion</p></div>

        <p class="paragraph">This large mass is the reason for sun’s “more gravity” than the earth’s. If the mass of a body is higher, then its gravity also will be higher. Since the Sun has greater mass than Earth, it has higher gravity. Yes, the Sun has more gravity than Earth in case we are talking about acceleration due to gravity.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest planet in the Solar System, after Jupiter. Named after the Roman god of agriculture, its astronomical symbol (♄) represents the god's sickle. Saturn is a gas giant with an average radius about nine times that of Earth. Although only one-eighth the average density of Earth, with its larger volume Saturn is just over.</p>
